		<h1>Project LO02 : Witch Hunt Â©</h1>
		<p>Documentation related to Witch Hunt project. This javadoc was generated in order to allow users to understand
			the code that has been implemented by our team. All the classes, methods and packages are detailed in this
			documentation in the corresponding part of the project sources.</p>

		<h2>Functionnalities</h2>
		<img src="../ressources/UseCaseDiagramV1.png" width="50%" alt="Usecase Diagram v1">
		<p>From the <a href="#useCaseDiagram">use case</a> perspective, compared to the functionnalities already
			developped for the 2nd livrable, we
			added the followings :</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The administrator can now select which views he wants during the party and how many</li>
			<li>A player can now demand to see his cards, the revealed cards or the discarded cards during the party
			</li>
		</ul>
		<img src="../ressources/UseCaseDiagramV2.png" width="50%" alt="Usecase Diagram v2">

		<p>Here is the window that you get when starting the program so that you can select the views you want :</p>
		<img src="../ressources/StartingScreen.PNG" width="15%" alt="Starting screen">
		<p>This window also has safeties :</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You can't click "OK" if you don't have any view selected</li>
			<li>There can't be more than 1 command line view (only 1 console, if it is used more than once, the output
				would be duplicated)
			</li>
			<li>The other views count choices are limited between 0 and 10</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Here are the changes related to the <a href="#classDiagram">class diagram</a> :</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Implemented the MVC pattern</li>
			<li>Created the View, PassiveView and ActiveView interface to classify all views and make it easier to
				manipulate them
			</li>
			<li>Added a simple text window interface as a first approach to make a graphical interface</li>
			<li>Added the fully graphical interface using the 2D Graphics</li>
			<li>Created a special view that use the composite pattern to make it possible to use more than 1 view</li>
			<li>Added safeties in the code, like the classes EffectList and TurnEffect interface which make it mandatory
				to put an effect that affect a player to be next in a list of effect
			</li>
			<li>Added more variety in the AI strategies, like a card user which focus on using cards when possible, or a
				random that does completely random actions
			</li>
			<li>Documented packages, classes, methods and attributes using Javadoc</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Current state of the application</h2>
		<p>The application is currently fully functionnal, all effects are implemented, AIs have fully working
			strategies, and the user inputs are secured (if the input type is wrong, we ask for a correction, if it is a
			particular case like clicking on cancel, we close the application).</p>
		<p>One choice that we decided to make is to not have the views be running in completely separate threads, but
			rather have them implementing a common set of methods using interfaces and be called (and therefore be
			blocking) when there is a need for user input. We think that it is easier that way to make it more modular
			(we can very simply add a new view, using a client and a server, for example. It just has to implement the
			necessary methods).</p>
